<p>I'm Nobody! Who are you?<br/>

Are you - Nobody - Too?<br/>

Then there's a pair of us!<br />

Don't tell! They'd banish us - you know!<br /></p>

<p>How dreary - to be - Somebody!<br/>

How public - like a Frog -<br/>

To tell one's name - the livelong June - To an admiring Bog!<br/></p>

<p>By Emily Dickinson (1891) Instructions:<br /></p>
